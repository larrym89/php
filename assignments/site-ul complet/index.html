                <h2>Info</h2>
                <strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers</strong> were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel
                Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the
                band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff
                Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The
                Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.</p>
