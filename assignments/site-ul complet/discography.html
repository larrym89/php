            <p>Since 1983, the American funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers has released 13 studio albums, two live
                albums, 12 compilation albums, 11 video albums (including promotional releases), five extended plays, 66
                singles (including promotional releases), and 53 music videos. To date, the band has sold over 120
                million albums worldwide. They have been nominated for 19 Grammy Awards, of which they have won 6. They
                have the most cumulative weeks at number one (87) and most top-10 songs (25) on the Billboard
                Alternative Songs chart.</p>

            <p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their first three studio albums—1984's The Red Hot Chili Peppers,
                1985's Freaky Styley, and 1987's The Uplift Mofo Party Plan—to virtually no commercial success during
                the mid to late 1980s. It was not until their fourth studio album, 1989's Mother's Milk, that the band
                received critical attention when the album peaked at number 52 on the Billboard 200. After releasing
                their fifth studio album Blood Sugar Sex Magik in September 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers broke into
                the mainstream. "Under the Bridge", the album's second single, peaked at number two on the US Billboard
                Hot 100. The album went on to sell over seven million copies in the United States (13 million worldwide)
                and became a foundation for alternative rock in the 1990s. Guitarist John Frusciante quit the band
                shortly thereafter in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall who was fired in 1993 being briefly
                replaced by Jesse Tobias before Dave Navarro was hired that same year. The band would release their
                sixth studio album, One Hot Minute, in September 1995. While the album was a sizable hit, peaking at
                number four on the US Billboard 200, it failed to match the success of its predecessor Blood Sugar Sex
                Magik. Navarro was fired in 1998 as the band was starting to work on their follow-up to One Hot Minute.

            <p>Frusciante rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998, and they released their seventh studio album,
                Californication, in June 1999. It was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200
                and being certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The
                album spawned six singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit "Scar Tissue". Californication
                was followed by By the Way in July 2002. By the Way peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and
                spawned commercially successful singles such as "By the Way" and "Can't Stop". Stadium Arcadium, the
                band's ninth studio album, was released in May 2006. It became the band's first album to top the
                Billboard 200.Stadium Arcadium spawned three straight number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs
                chart; "Dani California" spent 14 consecutive weeks atop the chart and also peaked at number six on the
                Billboard Hot 100. The band entered the studio in September 2010 to record their 10th studio album, and
                their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. Recording was completed in March 2011, and the album, I'm
                with You, was released in August 2011. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200; "The Adventures of
                Rain Dance Maggie", the album's lead single, peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the
                band's 12th number one single on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, a record they currently hold.
